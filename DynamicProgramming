Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence - Dp craete length array and seq array with i=1 and j=0

Maximum length of chain pairs----> sort by first then apply least increasing sequence algo using DP

Longest Bitonic subarray in an array take to array one for increment[inc[i]=inc[i-1]+1 if inc seq else 1] and one for decrementinc[i]=inc[i+1]+1 if dec seq else 1 seq then max = max<dec[i]+inc[i]-1 ? dec[i]+inc[i]-1 :max
