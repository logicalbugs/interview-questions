Minimum number of characters to add to the front if string to make it a palindrome.

Given a string s1, you need to add another string s2 at the end of s1, to make it Palindrome, return s2.

Given a string with each words are rotated by character corresponding to a given number (k>=1) , find out how many words can be identified as not rotated about 

given number. Basically check whether words about given index are palidromes or not, as rotation about middle index of palindromes gives the original word.

Given a string. Find all palindromes that can be formed.

Modified Longest Common Palindromic Substring.

Words reversal - Constant space - without substring.

Check if two strings are same if one of them is rotated by 'k'.

Length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Modified version of string reversal.

Find the first non-repeating character from a stream of characters.

longest palimdromic subsequence.

Longest common subsequence of vowel between 2 strings
----ex: str1 = abcytehi, str2 = avceyyui common subsequence of vowels = aei, lcs = 3  

Reverse string with spaces, in place. If string is a palindrome, append and prepend $
-----ex: str1 = zebra bat ball, reversed : arbez tab llab
		str2 = aba, reversed = $aba$  

Find a longest common subsequence that all the characters present in the subsequence should be of vowels
Eg : String 1: aieef     String 2: klaied     Answer: 3 (aie)
